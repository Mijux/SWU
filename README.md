## About The Project

I really like Github Pages, because it allows me to have a small static site without having to worry about administering it. I've been using GoHugo, the static site generator, for some time now. 

Recently, I wanted to create a GoHugo website but I didn't want it to be accessible to everyone. So Github Pages isn't the solution. So I was looking for a solution that would still allow me to automate the process of publishing the site with Github Actions. 

That's where SWU comes from. After receiving a github webhook, it allows you to update your website locally.

## Built With

* [Python üêç](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

You will find the steps to setup the project

### Prerequisites

You will need the following assets:
- A personnal server where you can run python program and store you static website
- A github action that creates a release (you can create releases manually)
    - [Here](workflow.example.yaml) you can find an example of a github workflow to create release
    - When creating a release, you must set its tag as *latest*
- A github webhook that is triggered when a release a created on you repository
    - You will need setup a webhook secret
- A [Fine-grained personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) with at least those repository  permissions:
    - *Read-Only* on **Contents**

    ```

2. Configure you .env
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then open it with you prefered editor to set the vars
    ```

3. Run
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

#### Systemd service

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mijux/SWU.git && cd SWU
    ```

2. Configure you .env
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then open it with you prefered editor to set the vars
    ```

3. Deploy service
    ```bash
    sudo bash deploy-systemd.sh
    ```

#### Manually

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mijux/SWU.git && cd SWU
    ```

2. Configure you .env
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then open it with you prefered editor to set the vars
    ```

3. Create you virtual env
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    .venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run it
    ```bash
    .venv/bin/gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py main:app
    ```

### Troubleshooting 

If you have error, it could a permission error, verify that SWU has the right to delete, create files in you WEB_ROOT. One possibility is to run SWU as www-data (if you WEB_ROOT is owned by www-data)
